### Attribution

I, Wayne, am not associated with the [diagrams package](https://github.com/mingrammer/diagrams), I just set this up to make testing the package more convenient. Examples mainly from [the documentation examples page](https://diagrams.mingrammer.com/docs/getting-started/examples). The other examples are from the documentation as well and links to the sources are ilcuded in the demonstration notebooks.
